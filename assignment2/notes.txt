EXERCISE 2.1
A. (*(expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1))

B. (logb (*(expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1)))

C. C-h C-h k does the same thing as C-h k by allowing you to input a keystroke and receive documentation + info about that specific keystroke. Similar to C-h b except C-h b is a list of keystrokes rather than info about a specific keystrokes

D. C-h k M-SPC gives info on what the M-SPC command does in a separate buffer. M-SPC puts exactly one space at the point, condensing all spaces around it to the point.

HOMEWORK
A. An indexing error is raised because the script cannot index a line that does not exist.

B. Syntax error occurs because the new version of python (python3) removed iteration over parameters which used to be valid in python2 for exception catching.
