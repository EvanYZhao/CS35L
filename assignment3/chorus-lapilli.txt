Section 1

- Copied tic-tac-toe code

- Created counter state to track when board is "full"

- Created two more click handlers for handling piece moving

- Branched between 3 click handlers based on board status and count

- Created another boolean state that tracks if user has chosen first piece

- Passed counter, 2 click handlers, and boolean as props to Square

- Implemented logic that checks if a move is valid or not

- Logic above checks for adjacency and if middle piece exists

- If middle piece exists, emulates board to check if move would win

- Added additional instructions that tell users what to do during play

- Added restarting of turn if user makes an invalid move

- Clicking a square to move would visually show user a "1" where they clicked
