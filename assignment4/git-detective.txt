0b55d930a69692 (main commit where explicitly fixed)

Methodology:
1. git tag -1 v2.39.0
   - Listed the tag "v2.39.0" (to ensure it exists)
2. git tag -l v2.38.0
   - Listed the tag "v2.38.0" (to ensure it exists)
3. git log v2.39.0..v2.38.0 > 2.38-2.39.diff
   - Created a diff file to show all the new commits from the old version to the new version where the patch was applied for the segfault
4. emacs 2.38-2.39.diff
   - Entered the diff file with emacs editor for extra functionality
5. C-s "segmentation fault"
   - Searched all the commits for the keyword "segmentation fault" and wrote down the commit ids
6. Discovered most relevant commit is the one that came first chronologically where the commit message explicitly states that the read-only repo segfault error was addressed
