Professor Eggert has the following branches:
maint
master
next
seen
todo

Whereas I only have the following branch:
master

This tells me that Professor Eggert has likely become a trusted developer who regularly commits to the git mirror repo since he has access to workflow branches as opposed to just the master branch
