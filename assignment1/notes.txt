4. Plain GCC: 12.2.0
   /usr/bin/gcc: 8.5.0

plain GCC gets updated

available.

12. PID 1

Homework:
Command 1: This command turns all non-alphabetical characters into newlines in the html file since the -c flag usees the complement of all alphabetical characters in both upper and lowercase
Command 2: This command squashes all the newlines into one newline at the very top, meaning subsequent words will not have spaces between them due to the -s flag on the tr command
Command 3: This command sorts the newly filtered list made from command 2 since getting rid of the punctuation leaves the list unordered and requires a resorting to get a proper alphabetically-ordered list of words
Command 4: Removes any duplicate words that may be encountered during the search process due to the -u flag on the sort command
Command 5: Returns 3 columns where column 1 is words unique to the filtered list from command 4, column 2 is words unique to the original sorted.words file, and column 3 are the words that both the filtered list and sorted.words share in common
Command 6: Returns only 1 column with the words unique to the filtered list created from command 4 in comparison to the sorted.words file due to the -23 flag on the comm command
